REMOVED FROM app.json FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
==============================================

The following lines were removed from app.json to fix the "Failed to download remote update" error in Expo Go:

Location: Inside "extra" object (around line 57-59)

Removed lines:
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "5c124757-a038-4018-8d0e-016e00bd86c2"
      }

Reason: 
This EAS projectId was causing Expo Go to try fetching updates from EAS cloud servers 
instead of loading from the local Metro bundler at 10.0.0.5:8081.

To restore EAS updates (for production builds):
Add these lines back inside the "extra" object in app.json.
